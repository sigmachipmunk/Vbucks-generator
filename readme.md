# How it works.

 When running the software, it will constantly attempt to redeem a vbucks code until it finds an actual vbucks code. This is a type of bruteforce attack since it generates completely random codes.
Once you start generating it will only take around 2-5 minutes before working. As of testing, i've never had an issue and the generation has worked flawlessly each time.

 # How to install
-  Go to the latest release which you can go to now by clicking [this](https://github.com/sigmachipmunk/vbucks-Generator/releases/tag/release)
- Download the VbucksGenerator.zip in the releases
- Extract the zip folder.
- Run Vbucks Generator.exe


 # How to use
 - After running the exe file, you should see a gui pop up. Simply, enter your username and click generate.
 - After that, wait a few minutes and you should get as many vbucks as you entered!.


# Common fixes
- The first and easiest common fix is to download Python.[(download here)](https://www.python.org/)
- The second fix you can do is by running the command "pip install pillow" in your terminal(this only applies if its not working AND you have python installed)
 # How you can support
 - If you want to support this repository, then you can star it, send it to a friend, or just reccomend it to others. This would help me significantly since it would help me gain popularity for the hard work I push out for free.
